# **Entertainment system for new people**
## Purpose
This is a group project for the COMP 3020 (Human-Computer Interaction) course at the University of Manitoba. We built a web-based application to introduce people to places/restaurants to hang out in Winnipeg. This project included researching our ideal target audience, what they would want to see in such an application, and how they may use it in everyday life. We relied heavily upon the principles of HCI to design this application. 

## Notes
* To interact with this website, please open the index.html located with this README file.
* A few things have been updated since our written report for this Milestone.
    * The calendar panel in the front page has been replaced with a clickable image of a calendar, which still mimicks the behaviour of selecting the calendar to view a full list of the event. 
    * The image for "A Charlie Brown Christmas" works on Google Chrome.
    * The info page of Human Rights Museum under 'Sights to See' is now functional and viewable.
