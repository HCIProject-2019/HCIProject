## Purpose
This is a group project for our HCI course (COMP 3020) in University of Manitoba. This project build a webase system introduce people to places/restaurants to hang out in Winnipeg.

## Notes
* A few things have been updated since our written report for this Milestone.
    * The calendar panel in the front page has been replaced with a clickable image of a calendar, which still mimicks the behaviour of selecting the calendar to view a full list of the event. 
    * The image for "A Charlie Brown Christmas" works on Google Chrome.
