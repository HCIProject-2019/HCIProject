Installing an Editor
A decent all-round editor/IDE is IntelliJ: download https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux
However, everyone has their own preference and you're welcome to use whatever you like.

Making Changes
Once you have Git installed, clone the repository, then change directory to it with this command:

$ git clone https://github.com/HCIProject-2019/HCIProject
$ cd wics-site
Next, create a new branch. You should name it something concise but relevant to what you're going to work on. Here I've used the name fix-broken-link to hint at what my branch will contain.

$ git checkout -b fix-broken-link
Now feel free to make changes to the site!


Submitting Changes
Now that you've written a great new feature, the next step is to commit those changes, and push them to the GitHub repository. Afterwards, you will make a pull request for us to review and merge.

First, we need to stage our files with this command:

$ git add .
Next, make a commit. Your commit message should concisely describe what you did.

$ git commit -m 'Fix broken link to CSS tutorial'
Now, push the commit to the GitHub repository.

$ git push origin fix-broken-link  # Remember to use the same name as your own branch!
Here, Git will ask you for your username and password. Enter your GitHub username and password here.

Finally, create a pull request. To do so, follow the instructions found 
https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

With all this done, you may receive some feedback or requests for changes, or it may be merged straight into the live website.
